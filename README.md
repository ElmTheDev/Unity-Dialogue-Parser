# Unity Dialogue Parser

- What is this?
  - This is dialogue parser written in C# for Unity game engine.

- What is this useful for?
  - This will make it easier for you to write story and dialogue for your game!
  
- Why did you make this?
  - Because before in my games I used JSON-based dialogue storing, this ended up making massive file for really short story. So I wrote this so I can write dialogue for my game's more easily.
